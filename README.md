# Web Audio API Exploration
I wanted to learn more about parsing audio data, so I made a simple React app.

Running the app in your browser:
```
npm start
```
The app displays the four basic sound waves: sine, triangle, sawtooth, and square. You can move around the frequency slider to see how the visualization changes.

**Note**: Pause the visualization before changing frequency type.
